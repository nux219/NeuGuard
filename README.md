NeuGuard: Lightweight Neuron-Guided Defense against Membership Inference Attacks


To check the model used in the paper, please:
1. Run all the cells above the '# start train';
2. Load model in the '# load saved model' cell and the following two cells to check the model accuracy
3. Load unsort NSH attack model in the '# load membership inference attack ' cell and the following five cells to check the model accuracy
4. Load sort NN attack model in the '# NN attack model' cell and the following two cells to check the model accuracy
